In some of my creative hobbies, such as writing or running TTRPG games with my friends, There were elements in the story where the players would communicate with entities or other characters with poor network reception which would lead to the voice messages and the like getting partially corrupted. To stimulate this, I considered to write a code where the letters (chars) would get randomly replaced by a hashtag (#) or any glyph symbol of my choosing. The application in of itself is very simplistic but the finer steps taught me few principles with randomisation and string builders. The app is very easy and straightforward to use so by all means, have fun :-)!
